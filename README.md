Overview:
  simple backend implementation of user databse with MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js with authentication
Background:
  I decided to make this project as a template of sorts for implementation of this type of project to save time of rewriting code and to not have to reinvent the wheel   everytime I need this for a project.
  The code is simple and was finished quickly, I added authentication using jsonwebtoken and a few other basic security checks.
  The code is very generic and can easily be integrated.
